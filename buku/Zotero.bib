	doi = {10.1109/MIC.2010.145},
	abstract = {Node.js — also called Node — is a server-side JavaScript environment (see http://nodejs.org). It’s based on Google’s runtimeimplementation — the aptly named “V8” engine.V8 and Node are mostly implemented in C andC++, focusing on performance and low memoryconsumption. But, whereas V8 supports mainlyJavaScript in the browser (most notably, GoogleChrome), Node aims to support long-runningserver processes.Unlike in most other modern environments,a Node process doesn’t rely on multithreadingto support concurrent execution of businesslogic; it’s based on an asynchronous I/O event-ing model. Think of the Node server process as asingle-threaded daemon that embeds the Java­Script engine to support customization. This isdifferent from most eventing systems for otherprogramming languages, which come in theform of libraries: Node supports the eventingmodel at the language level.JavaScript is an excellent fit for this approachbecause it supports event callbacks. For exam-ple, when a browser completely loads a docu-ment, a user clicks a button, or an Ajax requestis fulfilled, an event triggers a callback. Java­Script’s functional nature makes it extremelyeasy to create anonymous function objects thatyou can register as event handlers.},
